* allsvenskanBet

A Discord bot created for the Swedish football league [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allsvenskan][Allsvenskan]]. It primarily handles bets/challenges on/between matches/users on a guild (server). It's not built to handle multiple guilds currently. The only known running version exists on the officially unofficial Allsvenskan discord.

** Permissions
Scopes: bot, applications.commands
Bot permissions: Send Messages

** Layout
Every command has its own file, e.x. for the /refresh command, see ./src/refreshCommand.go. The bot connects to a postgres database where everything is stored. A configuration file named config.yml is expected to exist on the top-level of the bot.
